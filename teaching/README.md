## INSA -- 2021 (Toulouse, France)

These lectures make part of a complete course on stochastic processes lead by the French National Institute of Applied Science (INSA, acronym in French).
They are based on Gaussian processes and related topics. More precisely,
- A brief introduction to Gaussian processes with applications [[slides]](https://github.com/anfelopera/anfelopera.github.io/raw/master/teaching/INSA_GPs/slidesINSA_intro_online.pdf)
- Spectral representation and Bochner's theorem [[slides]](https://github.com/anfelopera/anfelopera.github.io/raw/master/teaching/INSA_GPs/slidesINSA_spectral_online.pdf)
- Regularity conditions (e.g. continuity, differentiability) [[slides]](https://github.com/anfelopera/anfelopera.github.io/raw/master/teaching/INSA_GPs/slidesINSA_regularity_online.pdf)
- An introduction to reproducing kernel Hilbert-spaces (RKHS) [[slides]](https://github.com/anfelopera/anfelopera.github.io/raw/master/teaching/INSA_GPs/slidesINSA_RKHS_online.pdf)

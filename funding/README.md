    + Scientific team: [A. F. LÃ³pez-Lopera](https://anfelopera.github.io/) (PI, CERAMATHS), [L. Reding](https://www.uphf.fr/ceramaths/membres/reding_lucas) (CERAMATHS) and [F. Bachoc](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~fbachoc/) (IMT).

## Internships and PhD offers

### Current offers
- Master internship (6 months) and PhD (3 years) funding on *"Gaussian process modeling of mechanical random fields: a complete study from simulation to identification"*. Both offers are funded by the ANR JCJC [GAME](https://anfelopera.github.io/funding/GAME) project.

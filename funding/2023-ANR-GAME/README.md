## ANR JCJC GAME -- GAussian process modeling of MEchanical random fields: a complete study from simulation to identification

This 4-year project (starting in November 2023) is funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR, abbreviation in French), as part of the call for young researcher projects.

### Summary
The ANR JCJC GAME project focuses on simulation and identification problems in mechanical systems. Our main interest are:
- Encoding expert knowledge into kernels modeling mechanical fields.
- Systems where inputs are fields (or distributions), and outputs are time-series.
- Theoretical guarantees of estimators for Gaussian processes with functional inputs.
- Parameter identification associated to mechanical fields from measurable quantities. 

The project proposes both innovative theoretical and numerical contributions that are of interest in research fields such as applied mathematics, machine learning and mechanics (but not limited to them). Our theoretical contributions are based on Gaussian process models with (multivariate or distribution) functional inputs and functional outputs. Since they may be independent of the mechanical applications, the resulting models can then be used in other research fields.
		
**Keywords.** Mechanical codes, stochastic modeling and simulation, uncertainty quantification, functional data, kernel design, machine learning, reverse-engineering.

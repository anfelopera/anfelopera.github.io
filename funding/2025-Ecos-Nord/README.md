### Summary
This project seeks to establish machine learning models that can account for large multi-source datasets and uncertainty quantification. The main interest are:
- Large-scale probabilistic models for multi-fidelity databases. 
- Inference methods for parameter estimation of the multi-fidelity models. 
- Applications in aerodynamic data fusion.
		
**Keywords.** Aerodynamic codes, probabilistic modeling and simulation, uncertainty quantification, multi-fidelity, machine learning, Gaussian processes.

### Summary

This research project aims to advance Bayesian methodologies for Gaussian and Student-t processes under target constraints (e.g., inequality, monotonicity, or convexity constraints), addressing critical challenges in engineering and machine learning.

* Constrained Student-t processes (TPs) under target constraints.
* Bayesian parameter estimation methods for constrained GPs and TPs.
* Applications to regression and optimization tasks in engineering and machine learning.

**Keywords.** Bayesian parameter inference, inequality constraints, MCMC, outlier-robust distributions, stochastic processes.

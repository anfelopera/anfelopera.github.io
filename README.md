## Summary
- Associate professor (Maître de Conférences, since 2021) at [Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France (UPHF)](https://www.uphf.fr/), [CERAMATHS](https://www.uphf.fr/ceramaths/en), Valenciennes, France. 
- Postdoctoral researcher (2020-2021) at [the French Aerospace Lab ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/fr/centres/toulouse) (Toulouse), France. Research project: *Design of experiments and surrogate models for aerodynamic data*.
- Postdoctoral researcher (2019-2020) at [IMT](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/) and [BRGM](https://www.brgm.fr/fr), France. ANR Research project: *Risk-based system for coastal flooding early warning (RISCOPE)*.
- Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (2016-2019) at [Mines de Saint-Étienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/), France. I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Olivier Roustant](https://olivier-roustant.fr/), [Ph.D. Nicolas Durrande](https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasdurrandehomepage/), and [Ph.D. François Bachoc](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~fbachoc/). The thesis was funded by the [**Chair in Applied Mathematics OQUAIDO**](https://oquaido.emse.fr/) [[activity report]](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03217277)
- M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (2013-2015) at [Universidad Tecnólogica de Pereira](https://www.utp.edu.co/), Colombia. I worked under the supervision of [Ph.D. Mauricio Álvarez](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/mauricio-alvarez).
- My research interests include applied mathematics, machine learning and computer science topics. More precisely, Gaussian processes, kernel design and probabilistic surrogate models.

## News
- I'm thrilled to announce that the 4-year ANR JCJC GAME (*GAussian process modeling of transient MEchanical random fields: a complete study from simulation to identification*) project, in which I'm the PI, has been successfully chosen for funding. This is a joint work with F. Massa, L. Reding, I. Turpin (UPHF), J. Bruchon and R. Le Riche (EMSE)!

Bachoc and O. Roustant, has been officially published at [NeurIPS 2022](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022)
- The paper [*"Modeling complex mechanical computer codes with functional input via Gaussian processes"*](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03882473/), a joint work with F. Massa, I. Turpin and N. Leconte, is officially published in the international conference [CILAMCE 2022](https://www.cilamce.com.br/)
- The paper [*"Sequential construction and dimension reduction of Gaussian processes under inequality constraints"*](https://doi.org/10.1137/21M1407513), a joint work with F. Bachoc and O. Roustant, is officially published in [SIMODS](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-mathematics-of-data-science-simods)

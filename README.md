I am also a research fellow at [Inria Montpellier](https://www.inria.fr/fr/antenne-inria-de-luniversite-de-montpellier), [team-project LEMON](https://team.inria.fr/lemon/).
- Former associate professor (Maître de Conférences, 2021-2025) at [Univ. Polytechnique Hauts-de-France (UPHF)](https://www.uphf.fr/), [CERAMATHS](https://www.uphf.fr/ceramaths/en), Valenciennes, France.
- Postdoctoral researcher (2020-2021) at [the French Aerospace Lab ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/fr/centres/toulouse) (Toulouse), France. Research project: *Design of experiments and surrogate models for aerodynamic data*.
- Postdoctoral researcher (2019-2020) at [IMT](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/) and [BRGM](https://www.brgm.fr/fr), France. ANR Research project: *Risk-based system for coastal flooding early warning (RISCOPE)*.
- Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (2016-2019) at [Mines de Saint-Étienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/), France. I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Olivier Roustant](https://olivier-roustant.fr/), [Ph.D. Nicolas Durrande](https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasdurrandehomepage/), and [Ph.D. François Bachoc](https://francoisbachoc.github.io/). The thesis was funded by the [**Chair in Applied Mathematics OQUAIDO**](https://oquaido.emse.fr/) [[activity report]](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03217277)
- M.Sc. in Engineering (2013-2015) at [Universidad Tecnólogica de Pereira](https://www.utp.edu.co/), Colombia. I worked under the supervision of [Ph.D. Mauricio Álvarez](https://maalvarezl.github.io/).
- My research interests include applied mathematics, machine learning and computer science topics. More precisely, Gaussian processes, kernel design and probabilistic surrogate models.
